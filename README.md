# Identification-of-Art-Paintings-by-Machine-Learning
Machine learning applications have been suggested for many tasks. We have investigated the suitability of applying machine learning to the problem of art identification, which we believe to be a new, but promising field. We want to examine how machine learning can be applied to the more general problem of identifying an artist’s painting.We believe that this can have interesting applications for art historians and scientists, helping them to understand in how far different artists’ works are similar, what some objective characteristics of an artist’s paintings are, and how machines might be used to authenticate paintings. The goal of this project was to classify a set of paintings, by labeling them with a predicted artist’s name. This section first describes our methodology for obtaining training and testing data before exhibiting our selection of features and the deployed classification algorithm. Our approach focuses on classifying works of seven different artists, by using some of machine learning classifiers. In phase 1 of the project we deploy classifiers such as (KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVM).In phase 2 our experiments will be focused on ensemble algorithms such as Bagging and AdaBoost
